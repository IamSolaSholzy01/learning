  * Dive into Vue component design (modular components, lazy loading).
  * Work with advanced Vuex patterns.

* **Practice**:

  * Add asynchronous background tasks (e.g., email notifications) in Go.
  * Refactor Vue app to use lazy-loaded components.

---

### **Week 6: Full-Stack API Development + Authentication**

* **Golang Goals**:

  * Implement real-time features using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE).

* **Vue/Nuxt.js Goals**:

  * Implement authentication using JWT or OAuth.
  * Securely store JWT tokens in Vuex or local storage.

* **Practice**:

  * Build a secure authentication system with Go API and Nuxt frontend.
  * Implement WebSockets for real-time updates (e.g., live chat or notifications).

---

### **Week 7: Full-Stack Deployment + CI/CD**

* **Golang Goals**:

  * Deploy your Go API using Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud services (AWS/GCP).

* **Nuxt.js Goals**:

  * Learn how to deploy full-stack apps using CI/CD pipelines.

* **Practice**:

  * Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for deploying your Go API and Nuxt frontend.
  * Deploy your app using a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, etc.).

---

### **Week 8: Final Optimizations + Capstone Project**

* **Golang Goals**:

  * Optimize Go performance (benchmarking, memory profiling).
  * Implement advanced API features (e.g., search functionality, image uploads).

* **Nuxt.js Goals**:

  * Optimize Nuxt performance (SSR optimizations, caching).
  * Work on advanced UI features (animations, smooth transitions).

* **Practice**:

  * Finalize the capstone project by adding advanced features.
  * Make sure both frontend and backend are optimized for performance.

### **Review Pipeline** (End of Each Week)

To track progress and make sure you're mastering the material, here's a **review pipeline** for every Sunday (or your preferred rest day). This will help you solidify concepts and evaluate if you’re on track.

#### **1. Concept Review**:

* **What did you learn this week?** Write down key takeaways and summarize core concepts.
* **What challenges did you face?** List any roadblocks or concepts you found confusing.
* **What do you feel confident about?** Identify topics you’re comfortable with.

#### **2. Practical Review**:

* **What did you build this week?** List the projects, apps, or mini-projects you've created.
* **What worked well?** Highlight features or functionalities that you implemented successfully.
* **What needs improvement?** Identify areas where you struggled or could improve (e.g., code quality, performance).

#### **3. Code Review**:

* **What did you learn from debugging?** Reflect on any bugs you fixed or challenges you overcame.
* **Can you explain your code?** Try explaining your code out loud or in a written form (great for testing understanding).
* **Refactor**: Go back to your earlier code and see if there are ways to improve readability, efficiency, or scalability.

#### **4. Time and Efficiency**:

* **Did you hit your learning goals?** Review your time commitment and whether you achieved your goals for the week.
* **Were there distractions?** Evaluate your focus and how effectively you used your study time.
* **Adjust your plan**: If you found certain topics too challenging or too easy, adjust your schedule for the next week accordingly.

#### **5. Plan for the Next Week**:

* **Set goals for next week**: Identify what you want to tackle next and set clear learning objectives.
* **Prepare for any challenges**: Look ahead to upcoming difficult topics or areas you feel you need extra focus on.

### **Sample Week Review Example: Week 1 Review**

**Concept Review**:

* Learned Go syntax (variables, loops, functions, structs).
* Struggled with goroutines and channels but managed to implement a simple parallel function.
* Feel confident with Go's basic syntax but need to review concurrency.

**Practical Review**:

* Built a simple Go CLI "Hello World" and a Vue to-do list.
* The Go app works but lacks error handling for invalid inputs.
* The Vue app is responsive, but I had difficulty with reactivity when adding new tasks.

**Code Review**:

* Had trouble with Go’s concurrency model. Debugged and figured out how to use goroutines to parallelize a task.
* Refactored Vue app to make state management more efficient by using computed properties.

**Time and Efficiency**:

* Hit my goals for the week but spent extra time on debugging concurrency issues.
* Found it hard to stay focused on the Go app. Need to break down learning into smaller tasks next week.

**Plan for Next Week**:

* Focus more on building the Go API.
* Refine Vue component structure and work on integrating state management (Vuex).
* Continue building the to-do app, adding API calls to interact with Go backend.
